The horrific incident left her angry,\\n                  but instead of lamenting over her fate, she started an anti-trafficking\\n                  organization Prajwala which works with the police and other law\\n                  enforcement agencies to fight commercial sexual exploitation.

She still remembers the horrifying\\n                  night when she was gang-raped in a moving car in Kolkata. A single\\n                  mother, instead of empathy she received criticism from the society who\\n                  called her “characterless” and also accused her of probably being involved\\n                  in prostitution! But one day Jordan thought to put an end to it and revealed\\n                  her identity to fight against the blames and the crime. “My children gave\\n                  me the strength to fight,” she said in a television show. “I want to instill in\\n                  them the feeling of being fearless.

Today she is living\\n                  a dignified life and demanding the justice which she deserves.

Instead\\n                  of getting defeated by this harsh reality, Sita not only sent her violators to\\n                  jail but also rebuilt her own life from scratch. Wheelchair ridden Sita did not\\n                  shy away from filing a complaint against her mother too, who was abetting\\n                  the criminals against her daughter. To give a new shape to her life, she\\n                  joined a bridge school run by Prayas NGO, and with the help of her\\n                  immense passion and will power, she managed to secure admission in\\n                  class eight at the government-run Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya\\n                  (KGBV).
